              <strong>Artist Statement:</strong>
              <br>
              <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a self-described digital generalist, I work in a variety of digital arts. This includes 2D and 3D, both as still images and animation, as well as some video. A large portion of my work is used as a sort of experiment in different methods of rendering, animating, camera tracking, etc. Essentially, most of the work I produce is created with the intent that I learn more about how the program I am using works, and how I can get it to do what I want. Some elements and principles of art that are very important to me in creating an animation include color, form, texture, space, contrast, emphasis, movement, rhythm, and unity. However, all elements and principles of art are important in at least one step of the process.
<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a lot that goes into 3D animation, which varies depending on what style I want to achieve. I start by brainstorming a story to tell, or a point I want to make. I do this by looking at a variety of facets to inspire me; everything from other artists (from any medium), the news, social media, or even music. After I get an idea of what I want, I try to figure out how to show that on camera. This includes not only creating a storyboard and a narrative, but also thinking about the style of how the animation will look. I then move to 3D programs to make the character and the scene. I primarily switch between Blender, Sculptris, and Zbrush for this. I use both Photoshop and Gimp to make the textures and materials that will be used in the 3D environment0; sometimes I use photographs that I have taken with a camera, but most of the time I simply paint the texture I need digitally. After I render the animation sequence, I take it into After Effects and/or Premiere for the finishing touches in what is considered post-processing, where I make all the transitions, adjust the color, and render it as a playable video file.
<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David Oâ€™Reilly is the most inspirational artist in my life currently. He is the reason that I got interested in animation; his style is so stripped of unnecessary beautification that it appeared very approachable to me, and now I strive to achieve that intentional bare-bones style, while still preserving the emotion and beauty that can be conveyed by an animated story. Most of my work is rather dark, but I like the juxtaposition of dark story with funny references or a cute but creepy character to bring about a laugh or two.
<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My future goals as an artist is to get a job working on a film, movie, show, or game. I would love to work as a generalist in a large production company, either for a video game or movie. Continued work in video games and animation/film will help me immensely with finding a job in the area I want.

              <strong>Biography:</strong>
              <br>
              <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric Charles is a student currently studying Art Sudio at the University of Kentucky. Born in Lexington, KY, in 1994, Eric grew up with an interest in computers and video games, and always considered a path in engineering or video game design. By the end of his senior year in 2012, Eric had already received 15 college credits from BCTC and was teaching himself how to make 3D animations and video games. He then transferred to UK where he got more experience in 3D programs in his spare time such as Blender, Rhino, Sculptris, Zbrush, Unreal Engine 4, and Maya, as well as receiving instruction in many Adobe programs, such as Photoshop, Illustrator, LightRoom, AfterEffects, and Premiere. After he is done with college, Eric plans on finding a job in the city as a generalist for films or video games, where he will work on the entire process of making the film or game.
